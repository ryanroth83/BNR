featured: true
---
Originally from Mexico City, I emigrated to the United States in the late 1990s. I hold a degree in Architecture from the Universidad del Valle de México and a Master’s in Urban Planning. In Mexico, I worked as an architect and founded two companies: Cantmex S.A. de C.V. and Natura Stone S.A. de C.V., with a subsidiary of the same name in Texas. As the founder and CEO, I oversaw the production of both industrial and artisanal marble and cantera stone.
Upon relocating to the United States, I continued my work as a builder and obtained my real estate sales agent license. I now hold a broker license for the State of Texas.
Throughout my professional life, I have been deeply involved in construction, real estate development, and real estate sales. Currently, I serve as the broker and CEO of G&G Realty Texas LLC and as the CEO of DAG Builders.
My extensive experience in real estate marketing, development, and construction allows me to provide comprehensive services to the increasingly demanding market of foreign investors looking to invest in the United States.
