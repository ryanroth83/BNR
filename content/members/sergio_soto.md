I have been a dedicated financial advisor since 2001, specializing in both international and domestic financial services. My career began in the international field at JP Morgan in April 2007 in Dallas, TX, where I served as an International Financial Advisor until June 2012. During my time at JP Morgan, I developed a deep understanding of global financial markets and became adept at managing diverse investment portfolios.
In June 2012, I moved to Citi Personal Wealth Management International in San Diego, CA, continuing to provide exceptional financial advisory services until November 2015. My role at Citi allowed me to expand my expertise and refine my wealth management strategies, solidifying my reputation as a trusted advisor.
Since November 2015, I have been with IBC in Houston, TX as an International Financial Advisor. My services include managing mutual fund portfolios, fixed income portfolios, and life insurance. I am committed to delivering tailored financial solutions, and my dedication to my clients has helped me build a loyal client base with assets exceeding $50 million USD.
To ensure I provide the best possible service, I travel extensively to meet with my clients, understanding their unique needs and offering personalized financial guidance. My extensive experience and deep knowledge of the financial industry enable me to navigate the complexities of international finance and optimize domestic investment strategies, helping my clients achieve their financial goals.
